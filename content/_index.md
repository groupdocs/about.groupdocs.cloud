#### Background

Due to growing customers' interest in using groupdocs.com APIs in the cloud, Aspose Pty Ltd launched its cloud version of groupdocs.com file format APIs together at the [groupdocs.com](https://www.aspose.com) website. However, for better management and maintaining growth of cloud APIs, the groupdocs.cloud website was later launched in 2018 dedicated only to cloud document automation APIs.

On average, every month [groupdocs.cloud customers](/customers) make **millions of API calls** and process **500K+ files** through our REST APIs.

#### Our mission

Our mission is to offer cost effective solutions for SMBs (Small and Medium Businesses) in the cloud for their on-demand document automation needs.

With [wide variety of SDK wrappers](https://products.groupdocs.cloud) built on top of our RESTful APIs for different platforms, it's easier for developers to use our powerful APIs to view, convert, annotate, compare, and much more across 100+ file formats in any language and platform of their liking with minimum learning curve.

We support some of the most popular file formats in business, including Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Outlook emails and archives, Visio diagrams, Project files, and Adobe Acrobat PDF documents.

#### Our websites

Besides groupdocs.cloud, Aspose Pty Ltd owns several websites with unique offerings in the file formats market under different brands. Feel free to [check our websites](https://websites.groupdocs.cloud/) for more details.
