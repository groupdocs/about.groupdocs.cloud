##### File Retention Policy

GroupDocs Cloud APIs allow customers to upload files to “GroupDocs Storage”. This policy outlines how we treat retention of those files for both Free Trial and Paid accounts.

<div class="clearfix"> </div>

##### **Free Trial GroupDocs Cloud API accounts using GroupDocs Storage**

For Free Trial accounts, files uploaded to GroupDocs Storage are retained for a minimum of 30 days before being deleted automatically thereafter. The customer can also remove these files at any time using the appropriate Storage API commands.

<div class="clearfix"> </div>

##### **Paid GroupDocs Cloud API accounts using GroupDocs Storage**

For Paid accounts, files uploaded to GroupDocs Storage are retained for a minimum of 90 days by default. The customer can remove these files at any time using the appropriate Storage API commands. The customer may also configure various automated file retention rules, (such as automatically deleting files after a number of days and other options), and exempt specific folders and files from the 90-day default using the account management screens.

Paid Accounts which are downgraded to Free Trial accounts by the customer, or by GroupDocs due to non-payment, will revert to the retention behaviour of Free Trial accounts 60 days after being downgraded.

##### **Files processed by GroupDocs Cloud API directly, without using GroupDocs Storage**

Files which are directly passed to the API in the request, or from an external storage, for processing but not specifically uploaded to GroupDocs storage are not retained by GroupDocs Cloud at all once processed. These files are not accessible to any person other than the person who uploaded the file.

<div class="clearfix"> </div>

##### **Deleted accounts**

If you request deletion of your GroupDocs Cloud account then all files you have uploaded will be deleted as part of the removal of your account.

*n.b. The above file retention policy outlines how we usually deal with the retention of files for Free Trial and Paid accounts. This policy does not affect the ultimate right of GroupDocs to request a GroupDocs account holder to remove any or all content as outlined in section 5.2 of our Terms of Service.*
