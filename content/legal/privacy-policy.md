 ### 6. Google reCAPTCHA

We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our websites. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a contact or signup form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as a website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information, like IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse movements made by the user. Data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google. The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our sites from abusive automated crawling and spam.

If you do not want any data about you or your behavior to be transmitted to Google, you must log off completely from Google and delete all Google cookies before you visit our website or use reCAPTCHA software. Data is automatically transmitted to Google as soon as you access our site. To delete this data again, you must contact Google support at <https://support.google.com>. By using our website, you agree that Google and its agents automatically collect, process and use data. You can learn more about reCAPTCHA on Google's web developer page at <https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/>.

A good overview of the basic use of data at Google can be found in the company's own privacy policy at <https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US>.
